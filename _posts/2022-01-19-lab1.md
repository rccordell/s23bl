In today's lab we considered clusters of media objects—from 17th century books to 19th century card catalogs to 20th century microfilm—and began to construct "media narratives" [in the vein of Alan Liu](https://companions.digitalhumanities.org/DLS/?chapter=content/9781405148641_chapter_1.html) to explain their connections and disjunctions. For this first book report, your goal is to do something similar for your chosen bookish object. What media narratives might you construct around its production, circulation, or remediations? How do those narrative help explain your object's cultural life, and what limitations do those narratives place around your object?
