In our visit to the Rare Books & Manuscripts Library, we considered a range of materials from across a wide geographic and temporal spectrum. You can find a list of the materials we reviewed, along with metadata and finding information, here:

The prompt for your book report entries is similarly broad, because I expect you identified a number of connections between your adopted book and the materials we discussed together. For your reports, then, dig into those connections: what aspects of your own book's history of writing, production, and use might 1-2 of the RBML artifacts prompted you to consider in a new light? What new questions were raised, and how might those new insights and questions speak with our readings?
