Today's lab will be our first focused on programming, and we'll be working in Posit Cloud, an online platform for programming in the R language. You will need to [join my workspace](https://posit.cloud/spaces/11704/join?access_code=5aeiqWjSoDjUD1rhC00do9LmobbvTpG6tRx5xXdp), which will require creating a free account. The rest of the lab will be in the project "BookLab" which we will access together.
