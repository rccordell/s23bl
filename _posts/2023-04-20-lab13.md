Today we'll be exploring networks using [Gephi](https://gephi.org/). There is a new online version called [Gephi Lite]() which is great for basic explorations of network data, but while experimenting with it this past week I was frustrated by the way the interface hides what's happening to the data, so we will use the full version for today's lab.

The files you will need [can be downloaded here](https://github.com/rccordell/s23bl/blob/main/assets/network-files.zip).
