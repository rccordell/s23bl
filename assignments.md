Your work in BookLab will unfold through these major assignments:

## 1. Discussion Prep

### Assignment Overview

+ Weekly
+ Students work individually
+ Posted to the discussion thread in Canvas for each class with assigned reading
+ Due prior to the beginning of the pertinent class period

### Assignment Details

For each week week of class there are readings listed under *Core* and *Penumbra*. The core readings are just that: central to the week's discussion and lab. Everyone should read these closely and prepare to discuss them. The penumbral readings try to capture a broader spectrum of scholarship pertinent to each week's theme, which I could not require because time is, sadly, finite. Each week you should choose one of the penumbral readings, based on your own interests, to read and be prepared to reference as a means of expanding our conversation together.

To prepare for our discussions, each week you should draft 2-3 substantial questions or critical observations that highlight details of interest from the readings, connect ideas across the week's readings (or even across different weeks), or probe the boundaries or limitations of the assigned texts. 

The goal of this assignment is not to test your knowledge of our readings, but to prompt dialog, so I try not to be proscriptive. In general, however, your discussion prep should:

1.  Get beyond basic questions or observations of fact and instead work toward questions or observations of significance.
2.  Demonstrate close thought about the frameworks of our texts, as well as about the relationships among them.
3.  Emerge from (and refer to) specific ideas, pages, quotations, scenes, &c. from our specific assigned texts rather than broad or generic concepts.
4.  Genuinely open toward discussion and debate during class (i.e. no leading the witness, your honor).

I would add to these one more, which I do not require but which I always encourage:

5\. Engage with our texts through a spirit of [generous thinking](https://generousthinking.hcommons.org/1-introduction/critique-and-competition/). I try to include a range of perspectives in our readings, and you will certainly disagree with some ideas in some of them. I assign a number of articles with which I disagree, because they articulate ideas I believe worthy of serious consideration! As we read and discuss together, we will find many opportunities for critique, so I would encourage you to work first toward understanding and contextualization—to pause, just a moment, when you feel that first impulse toward deconstruction to consider whether you are reading generously or suspiciously, and whether the mode you have chosen is in fact the right one for the rhetorical moment.


## Adopt-a-Book

### Assignment Overview

+ 6 reports of approximately 1000 words apiece, over the semester 
+ Students work individually
+ At least 3 reports due before March 11, all 6 due by end of term

### Assignment Details

Over the first two weeks of the semester, you will pick a work—perhaps literary, perhaps not—that you are interested in getting to know very, very well. Ideally one edition—or more!—of your work will be held in the UIUC Rare Books & Manuscripts Library. Throughout the semester, you will conduct ongoing research into the material and social history of your work using both physical and digital archives, and contribute short, regular reports in which you relate its history to our weekly course themes. 

#### Adopting a Book

There are a few rules for picking your work:

1. In general, you should pick a work that is at least 100 years old. Your job in this assignment will actually be easier if it’s even older. Essentially, you want a work with a long enough history—multiple influences, editors, owners, editions, adaptations, other cultural manifestations—that you will have lots to write about, and many ways to apply our course ideas to it. If you want to pick a more recent work, you should consult with me first.
2. Avoid works that scholars have already studied to an exhaustive extent. You may be very interested in _Hamlet_, but it might be difficult to find new things to say about its material or cultural histories. Fortunately, there are lots of books out there (literally millions) that have received little, if any, scholarly attention. A good many of these went through multiple editions in previous generations, even if they have not become canonical in ours.
3. If you are interested in books as data, you might make sure that your book has been digitized, and perhaps remediated into multiple digital editions (e.g. digitized images available through a collection such as HathiTrust, text data available for text mining). Even better if there are multiple digitizations you can compare.
4. I advise you to consult with me as you decide on a work. I reserve the right to ask you to switch—even after your first report—if your chosen work seems unlikely to lead to a successful assignment. I would much prefer—and I suspect you would much prefer—to have these discussions before you have invested significant time in research or writing.

#### Book Reports

As the semester progresses, you will use our readings, class discussions, archival visits, labs, and independent research to slowly unfold a history of your chosen book. You should think about these reports as an ongoing, incremental research paper. You will complete **six reports in total**.

Your reports will have three objectives: 

1. First, you should use them to reflect on our readings and discussions, and develop your own preliminary arguments in response. You should reference our readings regularly and directly, with citations in the style of your choice. 
2. Second, your reports should center on your chosen work, and expand your analysis of it in light of a specific week’s themes. Sometimes a week’s themes will suggest comparisons with the history of your work, and other times our themes might suggest contrasts. If you’re thinking creatively, I expect you will be able to relate any week’s ideas to just about any chosen work. If you are struggling with doing so, however, please do come chat with me during office hours.
3. Finally, your reports should reflect analytically on our work in the given week's Book Lab, connecting theory with praxis. With your chosen work as a fulcrum, your reports should use our readings and discussions to contextualize our applied work in laboratories, use our applied work in laboratories to enrich our understanding of concepts from our readings, and use both lab and readings to expand our understanding of your work's social, political, or artistic histories.

#### Logistics

There are no specific due dates tied to your Book Reports. You should choose weeks in which the themes particularly speak to you—or in which the themes have particular relevance to your chosen work—to inspire reports. However, there are a few logistical requirements to ensure that you manage your time effectively and, frankly, to ensure that I am able to provide regular feedback.

1. First, you may not submit more than one report in a given week, so you should plan for staged submissions rather than clustering them together.
2. Second, you must submit at least three reports before spring break (March 11) to ensure that your work does not cluster at the end of the semester, which will help both you and me succeed this term.

## Textual Technology Experiment

### Assignment Overview

+ An experiment that extends the work of a course lab or explores a new textual technology
+ A writeup of approximately 1500 words
+ Students work individually or collaboratively

### Assignment Details

Finally, once during the semester you will conduct your own experiment with textual technologies or media. In brief, you will either extend your work with one of our lab technologies, bring together multiple modalities from our labs, or even introduce a textual technology or medium we were unable to explore in class. Your goal will be to delve more deeply into a particular book technology or medium than we can in 90 minutes, gain a more robust understanding of the scholarly literature touching on that technology or medium, and produce a materially-engaged analysis. Your experiments should, like our labs, bring together theory and praxis and be engaged with material texts, capaciously construed.

I encourage enthusiasm and risk taking in these experiments. You may choose your topics and technologies at your own discretion, and complete your experiments on your own calendar, though I would not recommend putting your experiment off until the end of the semester. You may also collaborate on these experiments if you and a colleague want to explore a similar technology.

## Method of Assessment

### The Trouble with Grading

As you no doubt know, grading can be a contentious issue in college courses, particularly in writing- and discussion-based courses, where grades can seem arbitrary and contestable. Grading in school does not much resemble the way you will be evaluated in your lives or careers, where you will define many of your own goals and be measured by how responsibly and effectively you achieve them. For these reasons, [in my undergraduate classes](https://s19tot.ryancordell.org/assignments/) I have moved toward contract grading. To quote Cathy Davidson, a professor at CUNY from whom most of my ideas about contract grading are adapted:

> The advantage of contract grading is that you, the student, decide how much work you wish to do this semester; if you complete that work on time and satisfactorily, you will receive the grade for which you contracted. This means planning ahead, thinking about all of your obligations and responsibilities this semester and also determining what grade you want or need in this course. The advantage of contract grading to the professor is no whining, no special pleading, on the students part. If you complete the work you contracted for, you get the grade. Done. I respect the student who only needs a C, who has other obligations that preclude doing all of the requirements to earn an A in the course, and who contracts for the C and carries out the contract perfectly. (This is another one of those major life skills: taking responsibility for your own workflow.)

In graduate courses, however, these issues are even more acute, as you professionalize away from away a system in which you are assigned letter grades and toward a system where you must take ownership of your own work, ensuring it meets the standards of professional performance, service, research, and writing. Your professors will give you feedback and guidance—and will at points decide whether your work is sufficient to move to the next stage—but your theses, comprehensive exam papers, or dissertation chapters will likely not be given A's or B's. In your work experiences, you will certainly not be given letter grades, but instead be evaluated in other ways, often with your own participation. 

In addition, BookLab is an experimental course in which I want you to feel empowered to experiment and even sometimes to fail. I want to create an environment in which intellectual risk-taking and creative scholarship can be rewarded, even when it does not pan out as hoped. 

### Consultative Grading

Ultimately, the university will require me to assign a grade to your work this semester. In order to address the concerns outlined above and create space for experimentation, you will assess your own work in this class in dialogue with me, as mentor rather than judge. You will ultimately grade your own work based by assessing your effort and performance across the course assignments as they relate to the goals you set for yourself, your work to meet those goals, and your intellectual growth during the class.

Formally, this means that I will ask you to draft self-evaluations a few times during the semester, including a final self-evaluation through which you will assign yourself a grade. Barring extreme circumstances (see the Adjustment Caveat below) this self assessment will determine your grade for the semester. Ideally, knowing this process in advance will free you to do more ambitious work from the beginning of the semester. 

#### My Commitments 

In order to foster your progress this semester, I commit myself to:

1. Providing substantive and timely commentary on your assignments aimed at cultivating your research skills, analytical abilities, and scholarly voice.
2. Making myself available for in-person consultation and practical help during office hours and at other scheduled times, including virtual meetings if we cannot find a mutually-agreeable time to meet on campus. 
3. Assuming no technical expertise from students going into any of our laboratories. We will begin at the beginning, so that no one feels left behind. In order to ensure this happens, I will listen carefully to students if they feel lost and adjust a given lab plan as necessary to keep everyone together.
4. Allowing students with expertise in particular technologies to challenge themselves and craft their own laboratory experiences beyond our work in class.
5. Working with you to understand your goals and methods when you take intellectual risks in assignments, even if the final product does not turn out as expected.
6. Respecting your identity, perspectives, and intellectual commitments in class discussions and assignments. I may push you to consider other perspectives, but I will not dismiss your thoughts or take them lightly. If you feel I am doing either of those things, I will listen and adjust my responses as necessary. See our class code of conduct for more details.

#### Your Commitments

This system will only work, however, if you also commit to:

1. Holding yourself to the highest standards. You should work to the best of your abilities throughout the semester in your reading, class-room conversation, and assignments. 
2. Taking intellectual risks when possible, pushing yourself to think, write, and create in new modes and grown as a scholar and teacher. This may prompt anxiety, which you can work through by doing and with my help (see above).
3. Experimenting with new tools and learning new technical skills with enthusiasm and an open mind.
4. Assisting your colleagues with our laboratories when you have prior expertise, or if you acquire it more quickly during the lab itself.
5. Clearly articulating your goals and methods when you take intellectual risks in assignments so that I can understand what you are seeking to do, even if the final product does not turn out as expected.
6. Respecting your colleagues' identity, perspectives, and intellectual commitments in class discussions and assignments. You may push them to consider other perspectives, but you should not dismiss their thoughts or take them lightly. If someone feels you are doing either of those things, you should listen and adjust your responses as necessary. See our class code of conduct for more details.
7. Meeting with me, in person or via Skype, at least two times during the semester to discuss your work and ensure you are meeting expectations (my own and yours) for work in the class. 

#### Adjustment Caveat

I do reserve the right to adjust grades as appropriate, if a student takes undue advantage of the consultative grading paradigm. However, I have never needed, and do not anticipate needing, to exercise this right.

### Incomplete grades

Students must initiate an incomplete request by __contacting the instructor. The instructor and student must agree on a due date for completion of coursework.__ The student must fill out the Incomplete Form and get it signed by the student, the instructor, and the student's academic adviser.

A request for an incomplete grade is most often granted to students encountering a medical emergency or other extraordinary circumstances beyond their control. Students must request an incomplete grade from the instructor. The instructor and student will agree on a due date for completion of coursework. The student must submit an Incomplete Form signed by the student, the instructor, and the student&#39;s academic advisor to the front office: [https://uofi.app.box.com/s/sx7arobhr0gfw12teaetmp1qq32ifdrd](https://uofi.app.box.com/s/sx7arobhr0gfw12teaetmp1qq32ifdrd)
